# HashDNA Art Engine (WIP)

HashDNA is a collection of open-source tools and projects aimed at making NFT development easier and more efficient for artists and developers, even those without any technical expertise.

The HashDNA Art Engine is designed to assist artists in generating 10,000 NFT images based on traits, without requiring any programming knowledge. Inspired by HashLips Art Engine, we offer a user-friendly graphical interface so that no coding is required.

Moreover, we provide advanced and highly customizable generation rules that enhance artists' creativity in generating NFT images. We also offer professional features for managing metadata JSON, making it easier for NFT developers to integrate with our tools.
